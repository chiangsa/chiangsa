# Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Shaun, a 3rd year CS student at the University of California, Irvine.

#### -Why Computer Science?

With code, you can create, borrow, and build whatever you want.  
Plus, code isn't material, so it doesn't even hurt when you [step on it](https://i.imgflip.com/4u5bsf.jpg)! [<s>Until you find a bug ðŸ˜¬</s>](https://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/February2016/DevBug.png)
